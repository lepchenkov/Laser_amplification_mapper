# Laser amplication mapper 
The repository contains several examples of gain visualization across the laser amplifier rod obtained by dividing amplified beam distribution by master beam distribution.  

## Installation
Install requirements.txt.

## Usage
Is you have csv files of equal size you can divide one by another and visualize the result by using one of jupyter notebooks. In my case this procedure appeared to be extremely helpful, although technically it is fairly simple. The notebooks contain step-by-step instructions on importing, cleaning, scaling and visualizing the data.

This method of visualization is applicable to small signals.
